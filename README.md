Hello, 

[AltDevBlogADay](http://altdevblogaday.org/2011/01/15/it-begins/) is a collection of articles by game developers. It is very inclusive and for this reason may be hard to read. This repository aims to highlight my favorite articles, hopefully those which will become classics. 

Since learning from failure is also interesting, I'm thinking about adding a criticism section.
