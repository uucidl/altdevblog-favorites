Hello,

Note: By now the original blog website is down and of course most of these links now fail. Thanks, transient internet! There is a strong possibility you can find these articles however when looking via google, so try it!

[AltDevBlogADay](http://altdevblogaday.com/2011/01/15/it-begins/) is a collection of articles by game developers. It is very inclusive and for this reason may be hard to read. This repository aims to highlight my favorite articles, hopefully those which will become classics.

Since learning from failure is also interesting, I'm thinking about adding a criticism section.
